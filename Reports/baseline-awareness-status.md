# Baseline Awareness Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
FountainAI Baseline Awareness manages baselines, drift, patterns, reflections and semantic analytics.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/baseline-awareness.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 11
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/baseline-awareness`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/baseline-awareness`
- Server handlers are stubs returning empty `HTTPResponse` values
- Client requests decode responses as raw `Data`
- No dedicated tests for this service beyond generator fixtures

## Next Steps toward Production
- Expand OpenAPI parser to handle request/response schemas and parameters
- Generate typed models so handlers and requests use concrete types
- Implement real networking in the server runtime so the kernel can listen on a port
- Add integration tests between the generated client and server
- Provide container build instructions and runtime docs
