# Persistence Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
The Persistence service provides a Typesense-backed store for corpora, baselines, drifts and registered tools.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/persist.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 8
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/persist`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/persist`
- Server does not yet integrate with Typesense
- All responses are decoded as `Data` in the client
- No persistence-specific tests exist

## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement database adapters and connection configuration
- Emit typed models for persistence requests and responses
- Add integration tests verifying CRUD operations
- Provide containerization instructions for deploying with Typesense
