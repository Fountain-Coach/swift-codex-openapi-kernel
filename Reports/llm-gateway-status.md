# LLM Gateway Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
The LLM Gateway proxies requests to any large language model with function-calling support.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v2/llm-gateway.yml` (version 2.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 2
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/llm-gateway`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/llm-gateway`
- Networking layer is not implemented; server prints a startup message only
- Client responses decoded as `Data`
- No LLM Gateway-specific tests

## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement connection handling to underlying LLM APIs
- Generate typed models for chat requests and responses
- Add metrics endpoint integration and monitoring
- Provide Docker build and deployment instructions
