# swift-codex-openapi-kernel

*A fully Codex-compatible Swift 6 tool that generates both client SDKs and native HTTP server kernels from OpenAPI 3.1 — with zero dependencies on external frameworks like Vapor.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository implements a complete code generation workflow that:
- Parses OpenAPI 3.1 specs
- Emits fully typed Swift client SDKs
- Emits native Swift HTTP server kernels — no Vapor, no plugins, no hidden logic
- Ensures all generated code is deterministic, committed, and Codex-orchestratable

---

## ✨ What It Generates

### ✅ Client SDK
- `Codable` models
- Typed request structs per operation
- A configurable `APIClient` using `URLSession`
- Request/response validation via HTTP status codes

### ✅ Native HTTP Server
- Static router table from OpenAPI paths
- `HTTPRequest`/`HTTPResponse` types
- Route handler stubs
- Pluggable boot logic to launch an async Swift-based HTTP kernel
- Fully testable with standard `XCTest`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Build the generator**
   ```bash
   swift build -c release
   ```
2. **Generate code for all FountainAI services**
   ```bash
   ./regenerate.sh
   ```
   This command reads every `*.yml` spec under `FountainAi/openAPI/*/` and
   emits a dedicated client and server for each service under
   `Generated/Client/<Service>/` and `Generated/Server/<Service>/`.
3. **Generate code for a single service**
   ```bash
   swift run generator --input FountainAi/openAPI/v1/bootstrap.yml --output Generated/tmp
   cp -r Generated/tmp/Client/. Generated/Client/bootstrap/
   cp -r Generated/tmp/Server/. Generated/Server/bootstrap/
   ```
   Replace `bootstrap.yml` with another spec to target a different service.
4. **Run the test suite**
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```

### Updating the spec

Add or modify any service spec under the appropriate version directory inside `FountainAi/openAPI/`. Re-run
`./regenerate.sh` whenever a spec changes to regenerate the Swift sources.

### Troubleshooting

- **Parser errors** – ensure each YAML file is valid OpenAPI 3.1. The generator prints the failing file path on error.
- **Missing Swift toolchain** – install dependencies with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y clang libicu-dev swift`.
- **Build failures** – run `swift build -v` to see compilation output and verify you generated sources for the intended service.

## ✅ Codex Compatibility

Everything in this repo is:
- Written and structured in Swift 6
- Built from scratch — no generators, no plugins
- Deterministically emitted
- Fully visible in Git
- Designed to be test-driven and Codex-readable

---

## 📦 Continuous Integration

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow builds the package and runs the tests on
every push and pull request using Swift 6.

---

## 🐳 Service Containers

Each generated server directory contains a `Dockerfile` that compiles the stub
server into a minimal container. To build and run the `baseline-awareness`
service and expose it on port **8080**:

```bash
cd Generated/Server/baseline-awareness
docker build -t baseline-awareness .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 baseline-awareness
```

Once running, verify the service is alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

The container starts the Swift service and responds on `http://localhost:8080`.
See [deployment.md](Docs/StatusQuo/Reports/deployment.md) for more details.

### Docker Compose
To build and run all services together:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
## 🗓 Versioning & Changelog
The service specifications follow Semantic Versioning. Major API revisions live in directories like `FountainAi/openAPI/v1`. All changes are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for policy details.
## 📚 Documentation Structure
Historical docs live under [Docs/Historical](Docs/Historical/).
Current status reports reside in [Docs/StatusQuo](Docs/StatusQuo/).
