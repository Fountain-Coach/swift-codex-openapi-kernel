# Implementation State Report

The repository is a Swift 6 package named **SwiftCodexOpenAPIKernel**. According to the README, it aims to generate both client SDKs and native HTTP server kernels from OpenAPI 3.1 specifications without relying on external frameworks like Vapor. Key points include:

- Purpose and outputs are explained in the README, highlighting generation capabilities and deterministic workflows.
- Repository layout includes `OpenAPI/`, `Sources/`, `Generated/`, `Tests/`, and planning files like `codex-plan.md` and `.codex`.
- `Package.swift` defines multiple targets (`Parser`, `ModelEmitter`, `ClientGenerator`, `ServerGenerator`, and `Generator`) with several test targets.
- The sample OpenAPI spec (`OpenAPI/api.yaml`) defines one schema (`Todo`) and a single `GET /todos` operation.

### Current Components
Modules implement parsing, model emission, client and server code generation, and a CLI front end:

- **Spec Loader** uses `JSONDecoder` to parse the spec and performs basic validation.
- **ModelEmitter** creates Swift model structs and copies them into `Generated/Client` and `Generated/Server` directories.
- **ServerGenerator** emits HTTP request/response types, handler stubs, a router, and a kernel to process requests.
- Tests verify generator output with fixtures and check router behavior.

### Planning Status
`codex-plan.md` outlines phased work. Phases 2–6 (parser, model emitter, client and server generators, tests) are checked off, while several phase 0/1 tasks remain unchecked, including creating `agent.swift`, expanding `.codex`, and finalizing scaffolding. Documentation tasks in phase 7 are also open.

### Observed Gaps and Issues
- **Minimal `.codex`** — the manifest only declares repository name and compatibility; it lacks the structure, CLI, or test command details envisioned in the plan.
- **Missing `agent.swift`** — no orchestration script has been created in the repository.
- **Plan/checklist mismatch** — many phase 1 tasks (SwiftPM initialization, CLI product, generator sources) are already implemented but remain unchecked.
- **Spec loading** — `SpecLoader` only decodes JSON; README suggests YAML support, so YAML parsing is absent.
- **Generated output** — the committed `Generated` directory contains partial files (e.g., `Server.swift` is just a placeholder) rather than the full set produced by the generator.
- **Documentation** — while the README provides an overview and build instructions, usage examples and advanced guidance are still pending.

**Critique**

The project has a solid start: parsing, model emission, client and server generators, and a working CLI with tests. However, the repository identity and automation aspects (agent script, detailed `.codex`, CI setup) have not been finalized. The plan itself does not reflect the current implementation, which can lead to confusion over completed versus remaining work. Generated server files are incomplete, and YAML parsing is missing despite being part of the goal. Additional documentation would help new contributors understand usage.

# Improvement Agenda

1. **Finalize Repository Identity**
   - Implement `agent.swift` to describe orchestration behavior and how Codex should manage generation.
   - Expand `.codex` to specify project structure, CLI commands, and the standard `swift test` invocation.

2. **Update Execution Plan**
   - Mark completed scaffolding tasks in `codex-plan.md`.
   - Adjust remaining tasks to match the repository’s current state, ensuring the plan is a reliable roadmap.

3. **Enhance Spec Loader**
   - Add YAML decoding alongside JSON support.
   - Update tests to cover both formats.

4. **Complete Generated Output**
   - Ensure the generator emits all server components (`Router.swift`, `Handlers.swift`, `HTTPKernel.swift`, etc.) into the `Generated/Server` directory by default.
   - Provide a command or script to cleanly regenerate these files.

5. **Improve Documentation**
   - Expand the README with step‑by‑step usage examples showing how to run the generator on the provided `api.yaml`.
   - Include instructions for modifying the spec and regenerating code.
   - Consider adding a minimal GitHub Actions workflow for `swift build` and `swift test`.

6. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Explore better model property mapping (e.g., custom types, enum support).
   - Evaluate deeper validation of OpenAPI documents to catch more errors during parsing.

Addressing these items will close the gap between the current implementation and the aspirations laid out in the execution plan, delivering a more polished and self‑describing project.
