# Baseline Awareness Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
FountainAI Baseline Awareness manages baselines, drift, patterns, reflections and semantic analytics.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/baseline-awareness.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: **11** covering corpus initialization, baseline and drift ingestion, pattern storage, reflection management and analytics queries
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/baseline-awareness` now encodes request bodies and decodes typed responses
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/baseline-awareness` now includes `main.swift` with a simple socket runtime that parses headers and bodies
- Router decodes JSON bodies into models and forwards them to typed handler methods
- `GET /health` returns a structured JSON status while other handlers remain stubs
- A `Dockerfile` builds the service binary, and build/run instructions appear in the repository README
- New integration tests now cover corpus initialization and baseline ingestion in addition to the `/health` endpoint
- The `BaselineStore` now persists via `TypesenseClient`, sharing the persistence service infrastructure

## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement production analytics logic on top of the new persistence layer
- Expand documentation on building and running the service container
- Ensure integration tests run on both Linux and macOS using AsyncHTTPClient and the NIO server
