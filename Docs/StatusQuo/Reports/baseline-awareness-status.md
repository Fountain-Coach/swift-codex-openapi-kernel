# Baseline Awareness Service – Implementation Status

## Overview
FountainAI Baseline Awareness manages baselines, drift, patterns, reflections and semantic analytics.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/baseline-awareness.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: **11** covering corpus initialization, baseline and drift ingestion, pattern storage, reflection management and analytics queries
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/baseline-awareness` now encodes request bodies and decodes typed responses
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/baseline-awareness` includes a minimal socket‑based runtime and typed model definitions
- Router decodes JSON bodies into models and forwards them to typed handler methods
- `GET /health` now returns a structured JSON status while other handlers remain stubs
- A Dockerfile is provided and build/run instructions are included in the repository README
- No dedicated tests exercise this service beyond generator fixtures

## Next Steps toward Production
- Enhance the runtime to decode request bodies, extract parameters and return structured JSON
- Add persistence adapters and real analytics logic
- Provide integration tests exercising the generated client against the server
- Document how to build and run the service including the provided Dockerfile
