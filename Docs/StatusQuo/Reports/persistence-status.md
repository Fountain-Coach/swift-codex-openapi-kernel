# Persistence Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
The Persistence service provides a Typesense-backed store for corpora, baselines, drifts and registered tools.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/persist.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 8
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/persist`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/persist`
- Server uses an in-memory ``TypesenseClient`` for persistence during tests
- Client decodes typed models for all endpoints
- Integration tests verify corpus listing and basic storage

## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement database adapters and connection configuration
- Add integration tests verifying CRUD operations
- Provide containerization instructions for deploying with Typesense
