# Tools Factory Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
The Tools Factory registers and manages tool definitions consumed by the Function Caller.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/tools-factory.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 2
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/tools-factory`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/tools-factory`
- Server stubs do not persist tools yet
- Client uses `Data` decoding for all endpoints
- No dedicated tests

## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement storage to persist tool definitions in Typesense
- Generate typed models for tool registration and listing
- Add integration tests verifying function registration flow
- Provide API authentication mechanisms
