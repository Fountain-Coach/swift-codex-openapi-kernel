# Planner Service – Implementation Status

## Overview
The Planner orchestrates LLM-driven workflows across the LLM Gateway and Function Caller.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v0/planner.yml` (version 0.1.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 6
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/planner`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/planner`
- Router and handler stubs generated but not connected to an LLM
- Client uses `Data` for all responses
- No planner-specific test coverage

## Next Steps toward Production
- Upgrade API to stable v1 once semantics are finalized
- Generate typed models for planning requests and results
- Implement workflow orchestration calling LLM Gateway and Function Caller
- Add end‑to‑end tests simulating planning sessions
