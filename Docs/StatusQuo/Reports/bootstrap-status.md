# Bootstrap Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
The Bootstrap service initializes corpora, seeds GPT roles and adds baseline snapshots.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/bootstrap.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 6
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/bootstrap` with typed models
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/bootstrap` (handlers remain placeholders)
- Integration tests exercise the `seedRoles` endpoint using the async test runtime

## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement real persistence interactions via the Awareness API
- Flesh out handler logic for corpus initialization and role seeding
- Expand tests to cover full bootstrap flows
