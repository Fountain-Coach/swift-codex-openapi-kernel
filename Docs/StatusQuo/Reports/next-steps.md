# Next Steps Toward Stable Production Release

The individual status reports highlight that all FountainAI services share similar gaps:

- Generated servers lack a real networking layer
- Requests and responses use untyped `Data`
- No service-specific integration tests exist
- Persistence and external dependencies (Typesense, LLM APIs) are stubbed out

To move the project toward a stable production release:

1. **Extend the OpenAPI parser and generators** to emit typed models, parameters and response handling.
2. **Implement a minimal HTTP runtime** so each generated server can listen on a port and process requests concurrently.
3. **Wire service logic**: connect the Persistence service to Typesense, implement the Function Caller dispatch mechanism, and integrate the Planner with the LLM Gateway.
4. **Create integration tests** that exercise each service via the generated client SDKs.
5. **Add containerization scripts and deployment documentation** for running services in production.
6. **Document versioning and changelog policies** to track API stability across the microservice suite.

Following these steps will transition the FountainAI suite from generated stubs to fully functional, deployable microservices.
