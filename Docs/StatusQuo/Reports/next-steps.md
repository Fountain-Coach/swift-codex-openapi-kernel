# Next Steps Toward Stable Production Release

The services now share a minimal Swift networking runtime and typed request/response models. Basic integration tests run across all microservices using this runtime. Persistence is provided by an in-memory `TypesenseClient` and the LLM Gateway stub.

To move the project toward a stable production release:

1. **Connect services to real infrastructure** – hook the Persistence service to a running Typesense instance and bridge the LLM Gateway to a real model provider.
2. **Expand service logic** – complete the Function Caller and Planner implementations so workflows execute end‑to‑end.
3. **Harden testing** – grow the integration tests to cover more scenarios and enable CI metrics.
4. **Finalize deployment assets** – refine the Docker images and document production deployment.

Following these steps will transition the FountainAI suite from generated stubs to fully functional, deployable microservices.
